                This site will be using the Enlgish names, specifically the Funimation versions, for the sagas and movies, as well as the manga chapter/volume numberings.
                In the west Dragon Ball Z is treated as a separate, sequel series to Dragon Ball, rather than a continuation of the same story. So in the west the
                story starts at Volume 1 of DBZ whereas in Japan it would start at Volume 17 of Dragon Ball. If you wish to see the Toei names, and the original manga chapter/volume
                numbers they can be found on the <a href="https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Dragon_Ball_Z">Dragon Ball Z Wiki</a>.

                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Dragon Ball Z spans 18 sagas (19 if you're in the camp that splits the Saiyan saga into the Raditz and Vegeta sagas), 15 movies, and 2 TV specials.
                    These sagas, while centered around Goku, follow the Z Fighters as they struggle to keep the Earth and its people safe from a multitude of threats. From alien invaders
                    to insane wizards and many many things in between, these will be the greates challenges the Z Fighters have ever faced. They will face brutal combat, sacrifice,
                    and even death along the way. But they will also find new friends, forge new bonds, and expand their family, possibly even to those who were once counted as enemies.
                    Dragon Ball Z is the adventure of a lifetime.

                    <h3>Synopsis</h3>
                    <p>
                        Also known as the Vegeta Saga or the Raditz and Vegeta Sagas. This is the first saga in the Dragon Ball Z run. An alien named Raditz has landed on Earth.
                        He claims to be from a race of beings know as the Saiyans. These Saiyans conquer worlds, killing their native inhabitants and selling the now empty habitable worlds
                        to the highest bidder. He is looking for his brother Kakarot who was sent to Earth as a child. It turns out this Kakarot he's looking for is Goku, who knew
                        nothing of his origins much less his Saiyan name. The Saiyans are a dying race, in fact there are only 4 left in the entire galaxy. That is why Raditz has
                        shown up after all this time. There's a planet the Saiyans want to take over, however the people there are fairly powerful, and they need Goku's power to tip the scales.
                        However upon learning his brother has been living among the humans all these years instead of wiping them out and taking over the planet like he was supposed
                        to, Raditz changes tunes. He tells Goku he has just one day to kill 100 hundred humans as proof of his loyalty to the Saiyans. For extra incentive Raditz kidnaps
                        Goku's 4 year old son Gohan. Goku attempts to stop Raditz but is vastly outmatched by the alien's strength. In order to stop his brother and protect his family
                        and the people of Earth Goku is forced to team up with his arch nemisis Piccolo. Piccolo and Goku fight a desperate battle, just as its looking bad for Goku, his son, Gohan
                        unleashes a massive burst of power and injures Raditz. Seizing the opportunity Goku manages to restrain Raditz long enough for Piccolo to charge and fire his new attack,
                        The Special Beam Cannon. This attack mortally wounds both Raditz and Goku. Bulma, Krillin, and Master Roshi arrive in time to see the aftermath of the battle. They assure Goku
                        that they'll gather the Dragon Balls, 7 mystical orbs that summon a wish granting dragon when brought together, and wish him back to life. With his final breaths Raditz warns
                        the earthlings that the two other Saiyans have over heard their convorsation. They are vastly more powerful than Raditz and are now on their way to Earth and will be
                        arriving in one year. As Goku lies in the grass dying, Kami informs him of a great martial arts teacher named King Kai who lives in Other World. The gathered group
                        decides on a plan, they'll wait the full year to bring Goku back to life, that way he can train under King Kai in order to become powerful enough to deal with the
                        coming Saiyans. The rest of the Z Fighters will take the year to train as well. Piccolo having seen Gohan's combat potential decides to take the child and personally 
                        train him for the coming battle. Bulma, Krillin, and Master Roshi are quite uncomfortable with letting Goku's nemisis take his child, however they know what's at stake
                        and allow Piccolo to take him. Now somebody just has to explain what has happened to Chi Chi, Goku's wife, who is a superb martial artist in her own right and is not known
                        for taking this kind of news well.

                        As Piccolo and Gohan head off to train in the wilderness, Kami calls together the remaining Z Fighters to begin training at the
                        Lookout. Krillin, Tien Shinhan, Chiaotzu, Yamcha, and Yajirobe all answer Kami's call to train. As the Z Fighters train at the Lookout, Gohan is undergoing intense survival
                        training with Piccolo, and Goku is making his way down the million mile long path of Snake Way hoping to get to the end in time to train with King Kai. About 6 months pass
                        and Gohan completes his survival training and begins combat training with Piccolo. 3 months later Goku finally reaches the end of Snake Way and finds a small planet hanging
                        in the air. This is King Kai's planet, and Goku excitedly leaps to the planet in front of him. However upon entering the planets gravity well Goku is slammed into the ground.
                        Despite its small size this planet has a gravity ten times that of the Earth's. As Goku struggles to even walk on the planet he meets King Kai and begins his training. As Goku
                        completes his training with King Kai only a single day remians before the Saiyans arrive. It is then that King Kai realizes a flaw in their plan, Goku must make the return trip
                        all the way back down Snake Way. In a slight panic, King Kai has Master Roshi immediately summon Shenron and resurect Goku. Then Goku takes off at full speed trying against all odds
                        to make it back in time for the arrival of the Saiyans. A day later the Saiyans Nappa and Vegeta arrive on Earth. They destroy the city they landed in, and seek out the fighter with
                        the highest power level, under the assumption that person is the one who killed Raditz. Piccolo and Gohan are still out in the wilderness when they feel the Sayians head their way.
                        Piccolo also senses some smaller power levels heading towards them. They turn out to be Krillin, Yamcha, Tien, and Chiaotzu. The Saiyans arrive and reveal that Piccolo is also an alien who is
                        originally from the planet Namek. Nappa is unimpressed with the Z Fighters' power levels and decides to let some <a href="https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Saibamen">Saibamen</a> fight first.
                        Tien fights first and easily defeats it. Vegeta realizes the earthlings are concealing their power and then kills the defeated Saibaman. Yamcha takes on another one and appears to have
                        defeated it. However, the Saibaman gets up with surprising speed and grabs Yamcha. It then explodes, killing both itself and Yamcha. Krillin, enraged by the death of his friend, fires an
                        energy attack that splits into six beams and heads at the four remaining Saibamen and the two Saiyans. Krillin's attack kills three Saibamen, and the fourth is killed by Piccolo. The
                        Saiyans come out of the attack unscathed, and Nappa has decided to take the field himself. Nappa powers up and attacks Tien breaking off his arm, leaving Tien shocked and in great pain.
                        Krillin and Chiaotzu rush Nappa in an attempt to help. Nappa stops Krillin with an enery blast but doesnt notice Chiaotzu latch onto his back. In a desparate attempt to take out the
                        giant Saiyan Chiaotzu self-destructs, killing himself. Much to the Z Fighters dismay however, Nappa comes out of the smoke uninjured. Tien goes on an all out attack, but it proves useless
                        Nappa is just too strong. Even with the help of Krillin and Piccolo they're no match for the Saiyan warrior. Tien puts all his remaining energy into a one handed Tri-Beam attack which does 
                        nothing the to giant alien. Tien dies from the exertion of the attack. Just before Nappa can finish the rest of the Z Fighters off Vegeta tells him to wait. Vegeta wants to wait for Goku to
                        arrive so they can properly punish the traitor. He tells Nappa they'll wait three hours, and if Goku isnt here by then, they will finish off the earthlings anyway. Goku finally reaches the
                        end of Snake Way where he finds Kami waiting for him. Kami instantly teleports them back to the Lookout where Goku hops on Nimbus and heads for the battlefield, grabbing the last two Senzu
                        Beans from Korin as heads out. Goku eats one of the beans completely restoring his strength. Back on the battlefield the 3 hours is up, and Nappa attacks again. Piccolo, Gohan, and Krillin
                        execute a plan to grab Nappa's tail, a weak point in saiyan biology. The team finds out too late that elite warriors like Nappa have trained to overcome that particular weakness, when Piccol
                        is knocked unconscious upon grabbing Nappa's tail. Gohan and Krillin manage to hold Nappa for a bit, when Piccolo wakes up and anounces that he can sense Goku coming. Vegeta uses his scouter to
                        confirm and then orders Nappa to immediately kill everyone. Nappa launches a lethal energy blast at Gohan, but Piccolo jumps in the way taking the hit, giving his life to save Gohan. Gohan
                        is enraged by the death of his mentor and uses all his energy in a single blast, which Nappa blocks. Luckily Goku arrives in time to stop Nappa from killing Gohan or Krillin. Goku gives half
                        of the remaining senzu bean to Krillin and the other half to Gohan. Goku angered by the fact that so many of his friends have been killed attacks Nappa and easily overpowers him. Nappa attempts to
                        attack Gohan and Krillin in anger, but Goku stops him by using the <a href="https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Kaio-ken">kaio-ken technqiue</a>. Goku breaks Nappa's back and leaves him 
                        in the dirt at Vegeta's feet. Vegeta kills the injured saiyan and prepares to fight Goku. Goku tells Gohan and Krillin to leave the battlefield, then tells Vegeta he wants to go somehwere
                        else to fight. Vegeta agrees and follows Goku.

                       Goku and Vegeta face off in a desert. The saiyan easily overpower Goku, forcing him to use stronger iterations of the kaio-ken technique. At kaio-ken times three Goku is finally able to overpower
                       Vegeta, forcing him back. King Kai who is watching the battle from his planet is seriously concerned about how much longer Goku's body can hold up under the strain of the technique being employed.
                       He was never supposed to take it above kaio-ken times two. Vegeta realizing he cant win the fight flys into the air and begins to charge a world ending energy blast. Goku charges his signature attack
                       the <a href="https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Kamehameha">kamehameha</a> and they fire the blasts at each other in an epic clash of power. Goku wins the contest by using kaio-ken time four, however
                       this severely damages his body and leaves him in great pain. Vegeta returns and transforms into a <a href="https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Great_Ape">Great Ape</a> by throwing an artificial light
                       into the sky. He then begins to brutally attack the injured Goku, leaving him paralyzed and unable to fight. Gohan and Krillin rush back to aid Goku and end up distracting Vegeta long enough for
                       Yajirobe, who had been secertly hiding nearby, to cut off his tail. Gohan and Krillin manage to hit Vegeta with the remnants of a spirit ball Goku had attempted to use earlier in the fight and severely
                       injured the saiyan. Unnocticed by anyone Gohan's tail has regrown and he transforms into a great ape and goes on a rampage.  Vegeta finally manages to cut off his tail but it completely out of energy.
                       He crawls back to his space ship and is allowed to leave Earth, Goku having stopped Krillin from finishing the saiyan off with a sword through the back.
